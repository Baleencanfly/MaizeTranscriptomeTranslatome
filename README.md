# MaizePopulationTranscriptomeTranslatome
We sequenced the transcriptome and translatome of a maize natural population using RNA-seq and Ribo-seq, separately. Here we show the code used for the analysis.

Overview of Code Functionality in Each Folder:

1.ExpressionQuantification: Analytical workflows that process raw data to quantify gene expression.
2.PEERandGCC: Eliminate batch effects and calculate Gini correlation coefficients.
3.GWAS: Perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the transcriptome and translatome.
4.DetectAsite: Identify the A site position in ribosome-protected fragments using BAM files.
